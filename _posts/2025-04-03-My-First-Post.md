### what I did today: 
I just watched the Nintendo Direct for the switch two. 
##### my reactions: 
I am excited about the mouse capabilites for the controlers, the new Hyrule warriors: age of imprisonment, and the upgrade packs for breath of the wild and tears of the kingdom. 
I am **not** excited about the pricing or that the physical copys do not have the actual games on them and that I will still have to download the game. this is from what I have heard on twitter.
